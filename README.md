"This project is a Car Inventory Management and Order System that's name is "car store" built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript. It allows users to manage a car inventory, place orders for cars, and track the stock levels dynamically."
Highlight features:
CRUD operations for cars (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Dynamic order creation with real-time stock updates.
Validation for stock availability before placing orders.
Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose for object modeling).
Language: TypeScript.
Tools: Postman for API testing , eslient , prettier.
Version Control: Git.

Steps to Build the Project
1. Setting Up the Environment
Initialized the project with npm init and installed required packages:
Express, Mongoose, TypeScript, node, dotenv, eslient, prestier etc.
Configured TypeScript and set up the project structure:
Folders: models, controllers, routes, middlewares.
2. Building the Models
Car Model
Defined the Car schema with fields like brand, model, price, category, quantity, and inStock.
Included validations like:
Required fields for car details.
Enum values for car category (Sedan, SUV, etc.).
Order Model
Created the Order schema with fields for email, car (foreign key), quantity, and totalPrice.
Linked the car field to the Car model using Mongoose references.
3. Developing the APIs
Car APIs
Implemented the following endpoints:
Create Car: POST /api/cars
Adds a new car to the inventory.
Get All Cars: GET /api/cars
Fetches a list of all available cars.
Get Car By ID: GET /api/cars/:id
Fetches details of a single car by its ID.
Update Car: PUT /api/cars/:id
Updates car details (e.g., price or quantity).
Delete Car: DELETE /api/cars/:id
Removes a car from the inventory.
Order APIs
Implemented endpoints to handle orders:
Create Order: POST /api/orders
Validates stock, calculates total price, and creates an order.
Order Validation:
Ensures sufficient stock is available before placing an order.
Automatically updates the car's quantity and inStock status.
4. Middleware and Error Handling
Added a custom error handler to manage API errors:
Returns user-friendly messages for validation or server errors.
Included middleware for input validation ( email format, quantity limits).
5. Testing the APIs
Used Postman to test all API endpoints:
Sent POST requests with sample data for adding cars and orders.
Verified the GET, PUT, and DELETE routes.
Ensured stock updates dynamically after placing orders.
6. Database Management
Used MongoDB Atlas for database hosting and connection.
Managed relationships between Car and Order using Mongoose.
Project Demo
Show the Workflow:
Add a new car to the inventory (POST /api/cars).
Retrieve all cars (GET /api/cars).
Place an order (POST /api/orders).
Verify stock updates automatically after placing the order.
Update or delete car details as needed.
